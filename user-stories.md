1. **As a developer, I want to create an S3 bucket and an EC2 instance using Open Tofu so that I can manage my infrastructure as code.**

2. **As a system administrator, I want to ensure that the S3 bucket is private by default and the EC2 instance is accessible via SSH for secure management.**

3. **As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up an EC2 instance that runs an NCR service, which exposes a REST API accessible over the internet.**

4. **As a user, I want to access the NCR service's REST API and see the NCR/OpenAPI documentation online so that I can understand how to interact with the service.**

5. **As a security officer, I want to create a security group that allows SSH access and public access to the NCR service port, ensuring the instance is protected from unwanted traffic.**

6. **As a project manager, I want to document the infrastructure setup process so that new team members can quickly get up to speed.**
